## Factors affecting cost
 1. Resource Type and Model
     - Different services have different pricing structures. 
     - VMs are priced by compute time 
     - storage charges by capacity and redundancy
     - networking may include data transfer costs

 2. Usage and Billing Model 
     - Azure offers flexible pricing models 
     - pay-as-you-go : billed based on actual usage 
     - reserved instances : save with 1- or 3-year precommitments.
     - spot pricing : deep discounts for interruptible workloads.

 3. Service Tiers and Configurations. 
     - Services come in multiple tiers.
     - app services - free,basic, standard, premium
     - choosing more cpu, memory, performance features increases cost
     - region choice also affects price. 

 4. Licensing Costs
     - extra charges for windows or sql server licensing. 
     - azure hybrid benefit can save money if you have existing licenses.
 5. Data Transfer
     - inbound is free outbound is charged
     - inter-region transfers also cost money
 6. Idle or Unused Resources. 
     - vm that does nothing still costs money
     - reserved ips and orphaned disks can also generate charges. 
 7. Additional Considerations
    - access tiers ( storage )
    - marketplace services may add third-party fees
    - read/write operations on storage can have micro-costs
